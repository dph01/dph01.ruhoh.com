I'm an independent software developer writing web applications in Scala & Lift.
I'm based in Cambridge, UK, working in and around Cambridge, London and the South East.

I spread my time between developing my own software products and working on small-scale, short-term development contracts for external clients. If you need a someone to bolster your Scala development team in the short-term (e.g. to fill the gap while recruiting new staff, an extra pair of hands to cope with in spike to feature demands, etc.), then I'd be glad to hear from you.

With over 20 years of industry experience, I've written software in fields as diverse as Investment Banking, 
Financial Analysis, Oil and Gas Project Management, Satellite Image Processing, GIS Systems, and TV & Film Production Management. 
I've worked at a various technical and managerial levels including heading up a department of 20+ developers. I cut my teeth on C and Unix, progressed through C++ and Java and am now thoroughly enjoying the conciseness, elegance and expressiveness of Scala!
