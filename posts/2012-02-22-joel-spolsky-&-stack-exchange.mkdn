    <p><span style="">Went to an interesting talk this week at Cambridge Network - Joel Spolsky from Stack Exchange, Joel on Software, etc fame. Stack Exchange has 20 million unique visitors per month, only 50 employees &amp; Google use Stack Overflow as a benchmark: it isn't allowed to slip down the rankings after an algo tweak. Nice position to be in!</span></p>
